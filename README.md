H2Pack is a library that provides linear-scaling storage and
linear-scaling matrix-vector multiplication for dense kernel matrices.
This is accomplished by storing the kernel matrices in the
![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathcal{H}^2) or HSS
hierarchical block low-rank representations.  Applications include
integral equations, Gaussian processes, Brownian dynamics, and others.

**Features**

* H2Pack is designed for general kernel functions, including the Gaussian,
Matern, and other kernels used in statistics and machine learning. This is
due to the use of a new proxy point method used to construct the matrix
representations.  The common proxy surface method is also provided to
efficiently construct matrix representations for kernels from potential
theory, i.e., Coulomb, Stokes, etc.

* H2Pack requires less storage (for the same accuracy) than *analytic*
methods such as the fast multipole method (FMM).  H2Pack is faster
than *algebraic* methods such as those that rely on rank-revealing matrix
decompositions.  This is due to the hybrid analytic-algebraic approach
of the proxy point method.

* H2Pack achieves high-performance on shared-memory multicore
architectures by using multithreading, vectorization, and careful load
balancing.  Users can provide a function that defines the kernel function
or use kernels that are already built into H2Pack.
Vector wrapper functions are provided to help users optimize
the evaluation of their own kernel functions.

* H2Pack provides both C/C++ and Python interfaces.
A Matlab version of H2Pack is also available in this repo.

**Limitations**

* Kernel functions up to 3-dimensions
* Non-oscillatory kernel functions
* Translationally-invariant kernel functions
* Symmetric kernel functions
* H2Pack currently only supports kernel matrices defined by
a single set of points (i.e., square, symmetric matrices)
